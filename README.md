**action**

tmux  -  create new session with tmux 

`ctrl` + `b` -> `c`    to create new window terminal

`ctrl` + `number index of terminal tab` to change tab 



***By default, tmux creates a new session with a unique name for each new instance of the program that is run. This can be useful for organizing multiple sessions and windows, but it can also lead to confusion if multiple nested sessions are created.***
